# Topic Modelling on Open Ended Survey Responses

This project was made as part of the final project for the Nashville Software School Data Science Bootcamp

## Goal

* Identify themes found in open ended survey responses of the Tennessee Educator Survey
* Quantify prevalence of topics 
* Search responses to find similar responses to an exemplar

## Background 

Each spring, a survey is sent out to all educators across the state of Tennessee, including teachers and administrators. This survey is used to inform policy going forward and assess effectiveness of policies looking back.

Most of the questions ask survey takers to score a statement on a Likert scale (e.g. to what extent you agree or disagree with a statement about your education experience in this school year). But there is one open ended question at the end. This year the question asked "What would you tell the Commissioner are the two most important things for her to concentrate on over the next five years"
